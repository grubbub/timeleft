# Workday's End Countdown Timer
This started as a countdown timer to the workday's end.

I'd like to build it out with more features for fun.

## To Do 
* Add a landing page to ask for the end time 
* check the vibe button with some sass
* add a random fact generator 
* if there's time left prompt to play games
* maybe a prompt and text box to write something (like a dialy journal prompt or something)
  * have this be shareable somehow? 
* trivia? 



## Ok but why? 
* maybe some ads if it gets nice enough? 
  * Also, a default non-workday theme / setting. What if they come on a weekend.
